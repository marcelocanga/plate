# The Reissner-Mindlin Triangular Plate
<img style="float: left;" src="resource/3-plate.png">

The Reissner-Mindlin formulation is used for plates and shells of moderate thickness. The Arnold-Douglas implementation uses consistent linear interpolatios for rotations, enriched with an interior bubble mode and non-conforming linear interpolations for the out of plane displacements. The formulation is a three field mixed interpolation on rotations, out of plane displacments and transverse shear. The formulation avoids the so called locking problem.

## Building the program
Review the cmake file, CMakeLists.txt, in the program root directory.
The file requires the system libraries Blas and Lapack

From a terminal, in the program root directory make a build dir

mkdir build
cd    build
cmake ../
make

Now the program plate is in the bin directory
## Run the program

Go to the example directory
Run the program,
../build/bin/plate 3-patch.inp

The answers can be found in the file 3-patch.rep

## Example. 

<img style="float: left;" src="resource/3-plate.png">

### example/3-patch.inp 1x3 cantiler plate with fixed rotations and displacement in one end and distributed moment in the other end. Poisson ratio  = 0

Analytical solutions,

Rotation     = M L / EI       = 0.54
Displacement = M L^2 / 2 EI   = 0.81

E = 10^5
I = Thickness ^ 3 / 12
Thickness = 0.1
M = 1.5
L = 3
### example/3-patch-poisson.inp. Same problem as above but with Poisson ratio = 0.3 . Transversal side rotations are fixed to simulate an infinite long plate.

Analytical solutions,

Rotation     = (1 - PR*PR ) M L / EI       = 0.4914
Displacement = (1 - PR*PR ) M L^2 / 2 EI   = 0.7371

PR = 0.3
