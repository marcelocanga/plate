# The Reissner-Mindlin Triangular Plate
<img style="float: left;" src="resource/element.png">

The Reissner-Mindlin formulation is a plate and shell formulation of moderate thickness. The Arnold-Douglas implementation uses consistent linear interpolations for rotations, enriched with an interior bubble mode and non-conforming linear interpolations for the out of plane displacements. The formulation is a three field mixed interpolation on rotations, out of plane displacments and transverse shear. The formulation avoids the so called locking problem.

## Building the program
The program is built with cmake. Please
review the cmake file, CMakeLists.txt, in the program root directory.
The program requires the external libraries Blas and Lapack

* From a terminal, in the program root directory create the build dir

  *mkdir build*
  *cd    build*

* Run the cmake program builder,

  *cmake ../*

* Build the program with make using the generated Makefile

  *make*

If the build is succesful a new executable, plate,  will be available in the bin directory.
## Run the program

* Go to the example directory
* Run the program,
  *../build/bin/plate 3-patch.inp*

The generated output is available in the new file 3-patch.rep

## Example. 

<img style="float: left;" src="resource/3-plate.png">

### example/3-patch.inp 1x3 cantiler plate with fixed rotations and displacement in one end and distributed moment in the other end. Poisson ratio  = 0

#### Analytical solutions,

* End Rotation     = M L / EI       = 0.54
* End Displacement = M L^2 / 2 EI   = 0.81

* E = 10^5
* I = Thickness ^ 3 / 12
* Thickness = 0.1
* M = 1.5
* L = 3
### example/3-patch-poisson.inp. Same problem as above but with Poisson ratio = 0.3 . Transversal edge rotations are fixed to simulate an infinite long plate.

#### Analytical solutions,

* End Rotation     = (1 - PR*PR ) M L / EI       = 0.4914
* End Displacement = (1 - PR*PR ) M L^2 / 2 EI   = 0.7371

* PR = 0.3
